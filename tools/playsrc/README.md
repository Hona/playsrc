# playsrc Tool

## Objective

Provide one stable command interface for repeatable playsrc development, compilation, verification, and release operations.

## Responsibilities

- Validate local configuration before work begins.
- Resolve the repository-root `playsrc.local.json` independently of the caller's working directory and require exactly three accessible, absolute, distinct, non-nested roots.
- Resolve logical targets, call package interfaces, own child processes, and report exact results.
- Expose short commands for setup, direct-source compilation, development, verification, cache population, GLB export, publication, and release.

`bun run setup` verifies the checked Bun identity and installs the checked Rust toolchain under `sourceCacheDir`. It never changes a user-global Rust installation or shell path.

Map commands accept one checked logical target. `jump_beef` resolves to its exact TF2 map registry entry and verified raw-source cache objects; aliases and path arguments are rejected.

Native compilation and browser WASM compilation call the same owning Rust crates and use the same derived-cache identity. The tool can prepopulate caches but cannot make native preprocessing a browser gameplay prerequisite.

## Non-Responsibilities

- Implementing parsers, compilers, gameplay, presentation, or asset-store semantics.
- Accepting routine machine paths or stable build policy as command arguments.
- Discovering installations or searching the machine.

## Completion

Complete when every repeated supported operation has one deterministic command independent of the caller's working directory.
